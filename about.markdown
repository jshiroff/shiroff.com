## A Mile High Educational Journey

I'm a 4th-generation Coloradan and Denver Public Schools graduate. I‚Äôm so lucky to have a wonderful spouse and two amazing kids! I also love exercising, listening to music, diving into books, creating art, and soaking up the beauty of nature.


**University of Colorado-Boulder**  
I studied Environmental Population and Organismic Biology and community organizing through the [INVST program](https://www.colorado.edu/invst/) at [University of Colorado-Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu), learning that sustainable change requires both systems thinking and grassroots action.

**Peace Corps, Guatemala**  
After college I served in [Peace Corps](https://www.peacecorps.gov). Teaching in a rural Guatemalan communities, I discovered my calling as an educator and began my journey to becoming bilingual. Those classrooms taught me that excellent education is about building relationships and strong teaching practices.

**Back Home**  
I returned to Denver to teach and deepen my practices with a Master's in Educational Psychology and Principal Licensure at [CU-Denver](https://education.ucdenver.edu/academics/educational-specialist). Good intentions aren't enough‚Äîeffective leadership requires both heart and expertise. I taught and led many years at [Odyssey School of Denver](https://odysseydenver.org/) and [Barney Ford Elementary](https://ford.dpsk12.org/).

**Leading Today**
Today, I'm the proud principal of [Skyview Elementary School](http://skyview.adams12.org), where we're building something special: a learning community where every student finds their voice, every teacher grows their craft, and every family feels like they belong.
